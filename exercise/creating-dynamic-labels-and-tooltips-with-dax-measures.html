    <h1>Creating Dynamic Labels and Tooltips with DAX Measures</h1>
    <h3>üßÆ Function: VALUES, CONCATENATEX, SELECTEDVALUE, RELATED, SUMMARIZE</h3>

        <h2>üìö Theory & Explanation</h2>
        DAX measures can return text strings that dynamically change based on user selections and visual context within a Power BI report. This allows for personalized labels on card visuals (e.g., showing the name of a selected item) and rich, context-aware tooltips for charts. Key functions include `SELECTEDVALUE` for retrieving a single selected value, `CONCATENATEX` for iterating over a table and concatenating values into a single string (often with formatting and conditional logic), and `RELATED` or `RELATEDTABLE` for accessing data from related tables within the iteration.
    </div>

    
    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>üß© Example Use Case</h2>
            To provide a comprehensive customer activity report, you'd `SUMMARIZE` sales by `[Customer Name]` to calculate their total purchases. Within this summary, `CONCATENATEX` paired with `VALUES` could display a unique, comma-separated list of `[Product Categories]` purchased, even retrieving `[Supplier Name]` using `RELATED` from a dimension table to show their preferred vendors. Finally, `SELECTEDVALUE` would dynamically update your report title to reflect the currently selected customer, enhancing interactivity for the end-user.

        <h2>üéØ Your Task</h2>
        1.  Download and unzip the provided 'Music Tours - Dynamic Labels.pbix' file and open it in Power BI Desktop.
2.  Create a measure named `Selected Artist Name` that returns the name of the currently selected artist.
3.  Create a card visual at the top of both the 'Albums' and 'Tours' pages and assign the `Selected Artist Name` measure to them. Format the cards to align with existing text boxes.
4.  Create a measure named `Album Tooltip Details` that lists album titles along with their year of release, sorted by release date, with each album on a new line (use `UNICHAR(10)`).
5.  Assign the `Album Tooltip Details` measure to the tooltips of the pie chart on the 'Albums' page.
6.  Create a measure named `Track Tooltip Details` that lists track names, sorted by the `Track order` column. Add a gold star emoji (Windows key + '.') next to tracks which reached number 1 in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.
7.  Assign the `Track Tooltip Details` measure to the tooltips of the column chart on the 'Albums' page.
8.  Create a measure named `Tour Tooltip Details` that lists show dates and venues, sorted by show date and separated by a new line. The `RELATED` function may be useful here.
9.  Assign the `Tour Tooltip Details` measure to the tooltips of the column chart on the 'Tours' page.
10. Create a measure named `Country Show Counts Tooltip` that lists countries and the count of shows performed in them. Separate each country with a new line, sort them alphabetically, and ensure only countries with actual shows are included. Use the existing `Count Shows` measure if available.
11. Assign the `Country Show Counts Tooltip` measure to the tooltips of the pie chart on the 'Tours' sheet.
12. Save and close the report.
        <pre style="background-color:#27293d; padding:10px; border-radius:8px; color:#a5b4fc;">-- To create a new measure, right-click on your table in the Fields pane and select 'New measure'.
-- Replace 'Your Measure Name' with a descriptive name and the 'BLANK()' with your DAX formula.

Your Measure Name = 
    BLANK()</pre>
