        <h2>üìö Theory & Explanation</h2>
        Basic DAX aggregation functions (SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN) operate directly on a column's values. Iterator functions (SUMX, AVERAGEX) are more powerful, allowing calculations to be performed row by row within a specified table before aggregating the results. This enables more complex calculations that involve multiple columns.

            <h2>üß© Example Use Case</h2>
            Alright class, let's look at how these fundamental DAX functions are used every day to gain insights from our data.  ### SUM When you need to calculate the *total* of a numerical column, like the `Total Sales Amount` or `Total Units Sold`, `SUM` is your go-to function. It quickly aggregates all values within the current filter context to provide a grand total, which is essential for reporting key performance indicators.  ### AVERAGE To understand the *typical* value of a measure, such as the `Average Order Value` or `Average Product Rating`, `AVERAGE` provides the arithmetic mean of a column. This helps identify central tendencies and benchmark performance across different segments.  ### MAX If you need to identify the *highest* value in a column, perhaps the `Highest Sale Price` achieved or the `Maximum Temperature` recorded, `MAX` is essential. It highlights extreme values, which can be critical for outlier analysis or identifying peak performance.  ### MIN Conversely, to find the *lowest* value, like the `Minimum Profit Margin` or the `Lowest Delivery Time`, `MIN` is used. This helps in understanding bottom-end performance, identifying bottlenecks, or recognizing pricing floors.  ---  Now, let's explore their more powerful X counterparts, which are crucial when calculations need to happen *before* aggregation.  ### SUMX When your aggregation requires a *row-by-row calculation* before summing, like calculating `Total Revenue (Quantity * Price)` across a sales table, `SUMX` is indispensable. It iterates over each row, evaluates an expression for that row, and then sums the results, enabling precise aggregations for complex scenarios.  ### AVERAGEX Similarly, `AVERAGEX` is used when you need to calculate the *average of a row-level expression*, such as the `Average Profit Margin per Transaction (Profit / Revenue)`. It iterates through each row of a specified table, calculates the expression for each, and then averages those individual results, providing a more nuanced average.
