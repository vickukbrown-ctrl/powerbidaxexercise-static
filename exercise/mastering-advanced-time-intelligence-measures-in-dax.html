        <h2>üìö Theory & Explanation</h2>
        This exercise delves into advanced time intelligence by leveraging the CALCULATE function's ability to modify filter context. It combines standard time intelligence functions like DATEADD, DATESYTD, and SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR for direct period comparisons with more intricate patterns using DATESINPERIOD, SUMMARIZE, ADDCOLUMNS, and AVERAGEX to compute rolling averages of aggregated values (e.g., monthly totals) rather than daily values, requiring a deeper understanding of context transition and table manipulation.

            <h2>üß© Example Use Case</h2>
            As a DAX instructor, I'd show students how to leverage CALCULATE with powerful time intelligence functions like SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR, DATESYTD, DATEADD, or DATESINPERIOD to analyze performance trends. For instance, an analyst would use these to compare current sales (SUM) or average order values (AVERAGEX) against prior periods, calculating growth percentages using DIVIDE. Furthermore, SUMMARIZE and ADDCOLUMNS can then be employed to construct sophisticated summary tables, providing a detailed, dynamic view of these comparative metrics across various dimensions for business reporting.

        <h2>üéØ Your Task</h2>
        1. Download and open the provided Power BI (.pbix) file.
2. Create a base measure named `Total Quantity Sold` that sums the 'Quantity' column from your sales table.
3. Create the first DAX measure named `% of Previous Quarter` to calculate the current quarter's total quantity sold as a percentage of the previous quarter's total.
4. Create the second DAX measure named `YTD % of All Previous Year` to calculate the cumulative Year-To-Date total quantity sold as a percentage of the total quantity sold for the entire previous year.
5. Create the third DAX measure named `3-Month Moving Average` to compute the average of the total quantity sold for the preceding three months (averaging the monthly totals).
6. Add these three new measures alongside 'Year', 'Quarter', 'Month', and `Total Quantity Sold` to a table visual to verify your results against the exercise's expected output screenshot.
7. Save your Power BI file as 'Desperate measures'.
        <pre style="background-color:#27293d; padding:10px; border-radius:8px; color:#a5b4fc;">Total Quantity Sold = SUM('Sales'[Quantity])</pre>
