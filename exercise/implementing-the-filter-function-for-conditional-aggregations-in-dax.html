    <h1>Implementing the FILTER Function for Conditional Aggregations in DAX</h1>
    <h3>üßÆ Function: FILTER, AVERAGEX</h3>
    <p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Beginner</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>üìö Theory & Explanation</h2>
        The `FILTER` function in DAX is a table function that returns a table. It takes two arguments: a table and a filter expression. For each row in the input table, the filter expression is evaluated. Only rows for which the expression evaluates to TRUE are included in the resulting table. When `FILTER` is nested within an iterator function (e.g., `SUMX`, `AVERAGEX`, `COUNTX`), it first creates a filtered table based on the specified condition. The outer iterator then performs its calculations row-by-row over this newly filtered table, allowing for flexible conditional aggregations.

            <h2>üß© Example Use Case</h2>
            Students, when you need to calculate a *conditional average*‚Äîlike the average sales per order *only* for your 'High-Value Customers' or for products within a specific 'Electronics' category‚Äîyou'll powerfully combine `FILTER` and `AVERAGEX`. `FILTER` first isolates the relevant rows from your base table (e.g., all sales from 'Electronics'), and then `AVERAGEX` iterates over *that specific, filtered subset* to compute the average of your chosen expression, giving you incredibly precise and targeted insights.

        <h2>üéØ Your Task</h2>
        1. Download and unzip the provided file "Tallest Buildings - Filter Function.pbix".
2. Open the "Tallest Buildings - Filter Function.pbix" file in Power BI Desktop. You will see a chart showing the average number of floors for buildings in different countries.
3. Create a new measure named "Average Floors Before 2010" which calculates the average number of floors for buildings that opened *before* the year 2010, using a combination of `AVERAGEX` and `FILTER`.
4. Create another new measure named "Average Floors Since 2010" which calculates the average number of floors for buildings that opened *since* (including) the year 2010, also using `AVERAGEX` and `FILTER`.
5. Add both newly created measures to the existing chart.
6. Observe the updated chart, which should now display the average number of floors for both categories alongside the original average.
7. Save and close the report.
        <pre style="background-color:#27293d; padding:10px; border-radius:8px; color:#a5b4fc;">New Measure = 
AVERAGEX(
    FILTER(
        'YourTable',
        'YourTable'[YourYearColumn] < 2010
    ),
    'YourTable'[ValueColumn]
)</pre>
