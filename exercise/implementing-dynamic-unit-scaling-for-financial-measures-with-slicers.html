    <h3>üßÆ Function: HASONEVALUE, VALUES, DIVIDE, IF, BLANK</h3>

        <h2>üìö Theory & Explanation</h2>
        `HASONEVALUE` is a DAX function that checks if there is exactly one distinct value in a specified column within the current filter context. This is crucial for creating interactive reports where measures need to react differently when a single item is selected in a slicer versus when multiple items or no items are selected. When `HASONEVALUE` returns TRUE, `VALUES(<column>)` can then be safely used in a scalar context to retrieve that unique selected value, enabling dynamic calculations like unit conversion.
    </div>

    

    
        <div class="section">
            <h2>üß© Example Use Case</h2>
            As a DAX analyst, you'd often combine `HASONEVALUE` with `IF` to perform conditional calculations, for instance, to compute a `DIVIDE`-based percentage like 'Gross Margin %' only when a single product is in the filter context. When `HASONEVALUE` is true, you could even use `VALUES` to retrieve that specific product name for a dynamic title, otherwise, `BLANK()` would be returned, ensuring your visual handles totals gracefully without showing misleading percentages or division-by-zero errors.

        <h2>üéØ Your Task</h2>
        1.  Download and unzip the provided Power BI starter file.
2.  Open the Power BI file and observe the existing table displaying average box office takings, budget, and profit by film certificate.
3.  Import the `Units` worksheet from the provided Excel file into your Power BI model. Ensure this new table contains at least two columns: `Unit` (e.g., "$", "$k", "$m") and `Divisor` (e.g., 1, 1000, 1000000).
4.  Add a Slicer visualization to your report page, using the `Unit` column from the newly imported `Units` table.
5.  Create a new measure called `Average Box Office (Dynamic)`. This measure should use `HASONEVALUE` and `VALUES` to retrieve the `Divisor` corresponding to the unit selected in the slicer. It should then divide the existing `AVERAGE(Films[Box Office])` by this divisor. If no single unit is selected in the slicer, the measure should return BLANK.
6.  Repeat step 5 to create two similar dynamic measures: `Average Budget (Dynamic)` and `Average Profit (Dynamic)`, applying the same logic to their respective base measures.
7.  Create an additional measure called `Title`. This measure should display "Unit chosen: " followed by the name of the selected unit if a single unit is chosen in the slicer. If no unit or multiple units are chosen, it should display "No unit chosen".
8.  Add a Card visualization to your report page and display the `Title` measure.
9.  Replace the original Average Box Office, Budget, and Profit measures in your table with their new dynamic counterparts.
10. Test the report by selecting different units in the slicer. Observe how the figures in the table and the text in the `Title` card change dynamically.
11. Save your Power BI file.
        <pre style="background-color:#27293d; padding:10px; border-radius:8px; color:#a5b4fc;">Average Box Office = AVERAGE( 'Films'[Box Office] )</pre>
    </div>
