        <h2>üìö Theory & Explanation</h2>
        This exercise focuses on essential DAX date intelligence functions. `TOTALYTD` and `DATESYTD` are used for year-to-date aggregations, demonstrating how to accumulate values over a fiscal year. `PARALLELPERIOD` is crucial for shifting the date context to a preceding or succeeding period, such as the previous month, quarter, or year. `CALCULATE` is used to modify the filter context in which these calculations are performed, allowing for dynamic time-based analysis. The `DIVIDE` function is used for safe division to handle potential division by zero scenarios.

            <h2>üß© Example Use Case</h2>
            As an analyst, you'll frequently need to compare current performance against prior periods to understand trends. For example, to calculate Year-to-Date (YTD) Sales Growth vs. Prior Year YTD, you would use CALCULATE to modify the filter context, applying DATESYTD (or TOTALYTD) for the current period and PARALLELPERIOD to shift that date range exactly one year back. Finally, DIVIDE safely computes the percentage change, providing robust insights into your sales performance without error.
